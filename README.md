# Red cards visualisation

This is a visualisation, made in Processing 3. It tries to show, how red cards in football influence goals, scored by the team with a red card and the one without it. It also offers some interaction.

The dataset is taken from [here](https://datahub.io/collections/football "Football Data") and represents all matches played in the 2018/2019 season, where a red card was given.
